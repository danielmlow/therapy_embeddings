# Sequential modeling of psychotherapy modules to optimize session effectiveness

- Module Embeddings: Each of your 17 therapy modules gets mapped to a learned vector representation
- LSTM Processing: The sequence of embedded modules flows through an LSTM that captures temporal dependencies
- Effectiveness Prediction: The final hidden state predicts the effectiveness score

Th
1. Data Generation: Creates synthetic therapy sequences with realistic patterns, where certain module combinations (like A→B→A) are more effective.
2. LSTM Model: Uses embeddings + LSTM to capture sequential dependencies while predicting effectiveness scores.
3. Variable Length Handling: Properly handles sequences of different lengths using padding and packing.
4. Training Pipeline: Includes proper train/validation/test splits, early stopping, and learning rate scheduling.




Reproduce:

```
conda create -y -n therapy_embeddings python=3.11 seaborn ipywidgets ipykernel torch scikit-learn
conda activate therapy_embeddings 

```
